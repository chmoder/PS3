Pioneer 10 is still functioning 30 years after it was launched in 1972,
and is still sending back scientific data. The article mentions that two
other old space craft, Voyager, and IMP-8 are still functioning after
over 20 years as well due to overbuilt construction and redundant
systems. Can't help but wonder if the present generation of "faster,
better, cheaper" probes will ever live this long though."
